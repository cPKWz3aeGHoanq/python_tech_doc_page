        <h2>Invoking the Interpreter</h2>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter is usually installed as
          <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.9</code> on those machines where it is
          available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path
          makes it possible to start it by typing the command:
        </p>
        <div class="codeblock"><pre>python3.9</pre></div>
        <p>
          to the shell. 1 Since the choice of the directory where the
          interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are
          possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator.
          (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)
        </p>
        <h3>Argument Passing</h3>
        <p>
          When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional
          arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to
          the <code>argv</code> variable in the <code>sys</code> module. You can
          access this list by executing <code>import sys</code>.. The length of
          the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given,
          <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is an empty string. When the script name is
          given as <code>'-'</code> (meaning standard input),
          <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is set to <code>'-'</code>. When
          <code>-c</code> command is used, <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is set to
          <code>'-c'</code>. When <code>-m</code> module is used,
          <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is set to the full name of the located
          module. Options found after <code>'-c'</code> command or
          <code>-m</code> module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s
          option processing but left in <code>sys.argv</code> for the command or
          module to handle.
        </p>
        <h3>Interactive Mode</h3>
        <p>
          When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in
          <i>interactive mode</i>. In this mode it prompts for the next command
          with the <i>primary prompt</i>, usually three greater-than signs
          <code>(>>>)</code>; for continuation lines it prompts with the
          <i>secondary prompt</i>, by default three dots <code>(...)</code>. The
          interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a
          copyright notice before printing the first prompt:
        </p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <pre>$ python3.9 <br />Python 3.9 (default, June 4 2019, 09:25:04)<br />[GCC 4.8.2] on linux <br />Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.<br />>>></pre>
        </div>
        <h2>The Interpreter and Its Environment</h2>
        <h3>Source Code Encoding</h3>
        <p>
          By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In
          that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used
          simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although
          the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a
          convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these
          characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is
          UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the
          file.
        </p>
        <p>
          To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment
          line should be added as the <i>first</i> line of the file. The syntax
          is as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <pre><i># -*- coding: encoding -*-</i></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          where <i>encoding</i> is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
          presence or absence of prompts (<code>>>></code> and
          <code>...</code>): to repeat the example, you must type everything
          after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin
          with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary
          prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank
          line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the
          interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with
          the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A
          comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or
          code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a
          string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify
          code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when
          typing in examples.
        </p>
        <p>Some examples:</p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <i> # this is the first comment </i><br />
          spam = 1
          <i
            ># and this is the second comment <br />
            # ... and now a third! </i
          ><br />
          text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
        </div>
        <h2>Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
          expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is
          straightforward: the operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>,
          <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> work just like in most other
          languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (<code>()</code>)
          can be used for grouping. For example:
        </p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          >>> 2 + 2 <br />4 <br />>>> 50 - 5*6 <br />
          20 <br />
          >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 <br />5.0 <br />
          >>> 8 / 5 <i> # division always returns a floating point number </i
          ><br />1.6
        </div>
        <h2>Strings</h2>
        <p>
          Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be
          expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes
          (<code>'...'</code> ) or double quotes (<code>"..."</code> ) with the
          same result 2. <code>\</code> can be used to escape quotes:
        </p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <pre>>>> 'spam eggs' <i># single quotes</i> <br /></pre>
          <pre>'spam eggs'<br /></pre>
          <pre>>>> 'doesn\'t' <i># use \' to escape the single quote...</i> <br /></pre>
          <pre>"doesn't"<br /></pre>
          <pre>>>> "doesn't" <i># ...or use double quotes instead</i><br /></pre>
          <pre>"doesn't" <br /></pre>
          <pre>>>> '"Yes," they said.' <br /></pre>
          <pre>'"Yes," they said.' <br /></pre>
          <pre>>>> "\"Yes,\" they said." <br /></pre>
          <pre>'"Yes," they said.' <br /></pre>
          <pre>>>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'<br /></pre>
          <pre>'"Isn\'t," they said.' <br /></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in
          quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this
          might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes
          could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed
          in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double
          quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print()
          function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing
          quotes and by printing escaped and special characters.
        </p>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>
          Python knows a number of <i>compound</i> data types, used to group
          together other values. The most versatile is the <i>list</i>, which
          can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between
          square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but
          usually the items all have the same type.
        </p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <pre>>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br />>>> squares <br />[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be
          indexed and sliced.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Flow_Controls">
        <header>Flow Controls</header>
        <p>
          Besides the <i>while</i> statement just introduced, Python uses the
          usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some
          twists.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>
              <pre>if</pre>
              Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
              Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the
              <code>if</code> statement. For example:
            </p>
            <div class="codeblock">
              <pre>
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
More</pre
              >
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>
              <pre>for</pre>
              Statements
            </h2>
            <p>
              The <code>for</code> statement in Python differs a bit from what
              you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating
              over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or
              giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and
              halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the
              items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they
              appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
            </p>
            <div class="codeblock">
              <pre>>>> <i> # Measure some strings: </i>
... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12
                </pre>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>
              The
              <pre>range()</pre>
              Function
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in
              function <code>range()</code> comes in handy. It generates
              arithmetic progressions:
            </p>
            <div class="codeblock">
              <pre>
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4</pre
              >
            </div>
            <p>
              The given end point is never part of the generated sequence;
              range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a
              sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at
              another number, or to specify a different increment (even
              negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>
              <pre>break</pre>
              and
              <pre>continue</pre>
              Statements, and
              <pre>else</pre>
              Clauses on Loops
            </h2>
            <p>
              The <code>break</code> statement, like in C, breaks out of the
              innermost enclosing <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the
              loop terminates through exhaustion of the iterable (with
              <code>for</code>) or when the condition becomes false (with
              <code>while</code>), but not when the loop is terminated by a
              <code>break</code> statement. This is exemplified by the following
              loop, which searches for prime numbers:
            </p>
            <div class="codeblock">
              <pre>
>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
...             break
...     else:
...         <i># loop fell through without finding a factor</i>
...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
...
2 is a prime number
3 is a prime number
4 equals 2 * 2
5 is a prime number
6 equals 2 * 3
7 is a prime number
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3</pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              (Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the
              <code>else</code> clause belongs to the for loop, not the
              <code>if</code> statement.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

            </h2>
            <p>
              The <code>pass</code> statement does nothing. It can be used when
              a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no
              action. For example:
            </p>
            <div class="codeblock">
              <pre>>>> while True:

        <p>
          The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods

        </p>
        <ul id="list-methods">
          <li>
            <pre>list.append(x)</pre>
            <p>
              Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to
              <code>a[len(a):] = [x]</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <pre>list.extend(iterable)</pre>
            <p>
              Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable.
              Equivalent to <code>a[len(a):] = iterable</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <pre>list.insert(i, x)</pre>
            <p>
              insert(i, x) Insert an item at a given position. The first
              argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so
              <code>a.insert(0, x)</code> inserts at the front of the list, and
              <code>a.insert(len(a), x)</code> is equivalent to
              <code>a.append(x</code>).
            </p>
          </li>

        <header>Modules</header>
        <p>
          If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the
          definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost.
          Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are
          better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the
          interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is
          known as creating a <i>script</i>. As your program gets longer, you
          may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You
          may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several
          programs without copying its definition into each program.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use
          them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter.
          Such a file is called a <i>module</i>; definitions from a module can
          be <i>imported</i> into other modules or into the <i>main</i> module
          (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script
          executed at the top level and in calculator mode).
        </p>
        <p>
          A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The
          file name is the module name with the suffix
          <code>.py</code> appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a
          string) is available as the value of the global variable
          <code>__name__</code>. For instance, use your favorite text editor to
          create a file called <code>fibo.py</code> in the current directory
          with the following contents:
        </p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <pre><i># Fibonacci numbers module</i>

def fib(n):   <i> # write Fibonacci series up to n</i>
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

def fib2(n):   <i># return Fibonacci series up to n</i>
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
